# City_Estimator
A Recommendation System Project.
A recommendation system based on a user's input for a city to live suggests cities that are most suitable for the user based on their preferences and requirements. The system takes into account various factors such as rent, deposit, average salary, job opportunities, weather, city conditions, population, entertainment, traffic, and more. By analyzing these features, the recommendation system calculates the similarity between the user's input and existing cities using methods like cosine similarity. It then suggests a list of cities that closely match the user's preferences, enabling them to make informed decisions about where to live.
The recommendation system I built for city recommendations is based on real-life data collected through web scraping from local websites of different countries. 
For reaching data collection and analysis you can visit my other repository. Which is 'Living_In_Europe'.
